					    <p>
						    James Alan Hetfield (born August 3, 1963) is an American
						    musician, singer, and songwriter known for being the
						    co-founder, lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and main
						    songwriter for the American heavy metal band Metallica.
						    Hetfield is mainly known for his intricate rhythm playing,
						    but occasionally performs lead guitar duties and solos, both
						    live and in the studio. Hetfield co-founded Metallica in
						    October 1981 after answering a classified advertisement by
						    drummer Lars Ulrich in the Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler.
						    Metallica has won nine Grammy Awards and released ten studio
						    albums, three live albums, four extended plays and 24 singles.
					    </p>

					    <p>
						    In 2009, Hetfield was ranked at no. 8 in Joel McIver's book
						    The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists, and ranked at no.
						    24 by Hit Parader on their list of the 100 Greatest Metal
						    Vocalists of All Time. In Guitar World's poll, Hetfield was
						    placed as the 19th greatest guitarist of all time, as well as
						    being placed second (along with Metallica lead guitarist Kirk Hammett)
						    in The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists poll of the same magazine.
						    Rolling Stone placed Hetfield as the 87th greatest guitarist of
						    all time.

					    <p>
						    Lars Ulrich (born December 26, 1963) is a Danish musician,
						    songwriter, actor, and record producer. He is best known as
						    the drummer and co-founder of the American heavy metal
						    band Metallica. The son of tennis player Torben Ulrich and
						    grandson of tennis player Einer Ulrich, he also played
						    tennis in his youth and moved to Los Angeles at age 16
						    to train professionally. However, rather than playing
						    tennis, Ulrich began playing the drums. After publishing
						    an advertisement in The Recycler, Ulrich met
						    vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and formed Metallica.
					    </p>

					    <p>
						    Ulrich's drumming style has changed throughout his career.
						    During the 1980s he was known for his fast, aggressive
						    thrash beats. He would often utilize the double bass
						    technique in Latin breakbeats, which became highly popular
						    among heavy metal drummers. The best examples of this are
						    found in songs such as "Metal Militia" (Kill 'Em All),
						    "Fight Fire with Fire" (Ride the Lightning), "Battery",
						    "Damage, Inc." (Master of Puppets), "Blackened", "One",
						    "Dyers Eve" (...And Justice for All), "That Was Just Your
						    Life", "All Nightmare Long" and "My Apocalypse"
						    (Death Magnetic). Even though "Hardwired", "Moth Into Flame"
						    and "Spit Out the Bone" have the same double bass technique,
						    the 2016 release of Metallica's Hardwired... to
						    Self-Destruct saw a more aggressive and experimental
						    drumming style from Ulrich. Ulrich uses groove in his drum
						    style, including clean and fast double bass beats in many
						    songs and heavy drum fills. He has been known to drum in
						    sync with the rhythm guitar played by James Hetfield.

					    <p>
						    Kirk Lee Hammett (born November 18, 1962) is an American
						    musician who has been lead guitarist and a contributing
						    songwriter for the heavy metal band Metallica since 1983.
						    Before joining Metallica he formed and named the band Exodus.
						    In 2003, Hammett was ranked 11th on Rolling Stone's list of
						    The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2009, Hammett
						    was ranked number 15 in Joel McIver's book The 100 Greatest
						    Metal Guitarists.
					    </p>

					    <p>
						    At one point in his life, Hammett spent a "lot of money" on drugs.
						    Hammett has said that he used drugs because he thought they would be fun.
						    During the Damaged Justice tour, he had a cocaine addiction. Hammett
						    eventually pulled out of the addiction because cocaine made him feel
						    depressed, but relapsed during the Load era. One of the reasons that
						    Hammett spends a lot of money on comic books, is because he finds them
						    to be a more enjoyable (and healthier) alternative to drugs. Hammett
						    has also smoked heroin a few times, but "didn't like it".

					    <p>
						    Roberto Agustín Miguel Santiago Samuel Perez de la
						    Santa Concepción Trujillo Veracruz Bautista
						    (born October 23, 1964) better known as Robert Trujillo,
						    is an American musician and songwriter. He has been the
						    bassist of the American heavy metal band Metallica since
						    2003. He was also a member of crossover thrash band
						    Suicidal Tendencies, funk metal supergroup Infectious
						    Grooves, heavy metal band Black Label Society, and has
						    worked with Jerry Cantrell and Ozzy Osbourne.
					    </p>

					    <p>
						    Trujillo began playing bass for Metallica on February 24, 2003.
						    He had previously met and befriended his future bandmates when
						    Suicidal Tendencies supported Metallica during the Nowhere Else
						    to Roam tour in 1993, and again during the Shit Hits the Sheds
						    tour one year later. Trujillo received one million dollars from
						    the band as an advance for joining Metallica. His audition and
						    hiring as well as his million dollar payment offer appear in the
						    documentary film Some Kind of Monster. As the current bassist
						    for Metallica, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of
						    Fame alongside all current members of the band, as well previous
						    bassists Jason Newsted and the late Cliff Burton.
